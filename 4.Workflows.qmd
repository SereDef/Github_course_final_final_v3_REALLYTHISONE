## Let's get down to it 
[Now that we are done setting up, it's about damn time to see what was all this pain even for:]{.l-space}

In this section, we'll go over three *realistic* **workflows** you may use in you daily life

1. [**New project - `GitHub` first**]{.darkblue}: the easiest way to get a working project.
2. [**Existing project - `GitHub` first**]{.darkblue}: a deeply pragmatic way to get pre-existing work onto `GitHub`.
3. [**Existing project - `GitHub` last**]{.darkblue}: the more "*proper*" way to connect existing local work to `GitHub`, when there’s already some `Git` history.
4. [**Contributing to someone else's work**]{.darkblue}: your gateway drug to open-source heaven. 

## 1. Create a repository
It's (finally) time to make your first repository!

> Go to [`GitHub`](https://github.com) and make sure you are logged in. <br>*Click on your profile pic (top-right corner) > Repositories >* [New]{.green-button}.

Fill some info in:

> **Repository name**: Whatever you wish. Approach this as you would a *variable name*: descriptive but brief, <ins>no spaces</ins>. Letters, digits, `-`, `.`, or `_` are allowed.<br>
> **Description** (for humans): It’s nice to have something here, so you’ll see it appear in the `README`. e.g. *“Analysis of the stuff”*.<br>
> **Visibility**: Public or private (can always change it later)<br>
> **Add README**: generally a good idea, this is the landing page for your repo<br>
> **Templates**, **`.gitignore`** and **licences** we will talk about in a moment, ignore for now.

Click on [Create repository]{.green-button}.

## Clone your repo to your local computer
Now, on the repo page, click the big green button that says [<>&ensp;Code]{.green-button}.

:::{.column width="55%"}
[Copy a *clone URL* to your clipboard.]{.l-space}

[Remember when we talked about HTTPS and SSH? Here they are again.]{.m-space}

[The type of URL you copy determines the **protocol** `GitHub` will use, so if you have PAT set up, copy the HTTPS URL, if you are using SSH keys, go for SSH.]{.l-space}

Now, you have a few ways to get this onto your computer.

:::

## Clone your repo to your local computer
Let's use the URL we just copied from `GitHub`.

::: panel-tabset
### In the shell
[If your shell cooperates, you should be able to paste the whole `https://...` bit, but some shells are not (immediately) clipboard aware. In that sad case, you must type it (*accurately*), best of luck sailor!]{.m-space}

This should look something like this:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/<YOUR-REPOSITORY>.git
```

<br>

:::{.callout-tip title="Where am I?"}
Take charge of – or at least notice! – what directory you’re in.<br> `pwd` displays the working directory. `cd` is the command to change it.
:::

### In&ensp;`R`
Remember `usethis`?
``` r
usethis::create_from_github(
  "https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/<YOUR-REPOSITORY>.git",
  destdir = "~/path/to/where/you/want/the/local/repo/"
)
```
[The first argument (`repo_spec`) accepts various forms of GitHub repo specifications (see the [docs](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/create_from_github.html)). We will use the URL we just copied from GitHub.]{.m-space}

The `destdir` argument specifies the parent directory where you want the new folder (and local `Git` repo) to live. If you don’t specify it, `usethis` defaults to some very conspicuous place, like your Desktop. 

### In&ensp;`RStudio`
Start a new **Project**:

> File > New Project... > Version Control > Git > In "Repository URL", paste the URL of your new `GitHub` repo > Accept the default project directory name (i.e. the `GitHub` repo name) > And pay attention to where the Project will be saved locally > Check “Open in new session” (that’s what you usually want in real life) and click on [Create Project]{.grey-button}

:::{.callout-caution title="Troubles in paradise?"}
Do you NOT see an option to get the Project from *Version Control*? Restart RStudio and try again.<br>Still no luck? Check out these [troubleshooting tips](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-see-git).

## [Exercise]{.bg-jasmine}: make a repo and clone it

1. Create a repository (get creative) and give it a README
2. Clone it on your laptop
3. Make this new repo your working directory, list its files, display the README
4. Bonus: what does `git remote show origin` tell you?

## Make a local change and `commit` to it
Every time you finish a valuable chunk of work (probably a few times a day)

::: panel-tabset

### In the shell
Make the repo your working directory 
```sh
cd <YOUR-REPOSITORY>
```
[Let's make a small change:]{.m-up-space}
``` sh
echo "A line I wrote on my local computer " >> README.md
```
[I am happy with this change, now let's stage ("`add`") and `commit` to it]{.m-up-space}
``` sh
git add README.md
git commit -m "Look ma, a commit from my local computer"
```

### In&ensp;`RStudio`
Let's make a small change: e.g., adding the line *“This is a line from RStudio”* to the `README`. 

[Save your changes.]{.l-space}

[Open the [Git]{.grey-button} tab in upper right pane (or wherever you have put your "Environment" pane, you eretic).]{.m-space}

[Check the “Staged” box for the files you want to commit and click (surprise) [Commit]{.grey-button}]{.m-space}

[Type a message in “Commit message”, e.g. *“Commit from RStudio”*.]{.m-space}

[Click [Commit]{.grey-button}.]{.m-space}

:::

## Shall we tell `GitHub` about this?
Time to share (`push`) your changes with the world (or with `GitHub` anyway)

Now, this will seem counterintuitive, but first let’s stop and... **`pull` from `GitHub`**.

I doubt anything will happen (i.e. you’ll get *`"Already up-to-date."`*) but this is a good habit to catch... can you guess *why?*

::: panel-tabset

### In the shell

(optional) get most recent version from `GitHub`:
``` sh
git pull
```
[Send your local changes to `GitHub`]{.l-up-space}

``` sh
git push
```

### In&ensp;`RStudio`

[In the [Git]{.grey-button} tab in RStudio:]{.l-space}

[(optional) Click [Pull]{.blue-button} to get most recent version from `GitHub`]{.l-space}

Click [Push]{.green-button} to send your local changes to `GitHub`.

:::

## [Exercise]{.bg-jasmine}: make a change, commit and push it

1. Add a line to your README and verify that `Git` noticed the change
2. Stage and commit this change 
3. Push to your remote repo 
4. Did you get challenged for a password? 
    a. yes. why?
    b. no. why not? 
5. Confirm that `GitHub` registered the change
6. (optional) You think you could do this whole exercise directly on the `GitHub` webpage?

## 2. Exisiting project, `GitHub` first 
What if you already have an existing project, somewhere in a directory on your computer?

If this is not (yet) a `Git`-tracked project, it should *easy-easy*

:::{.incremental}
* First create a new repository on `GitHub` (whithout a `README` if happen to already have one)
* Clone it on you local computer
* **Bring your existing project over**, using your favorite method of moving or copying files.
* Check that your new files appear as *new untracked files*.
* Stage, commit and... wait
:::

:::{.callout-important title="&ensp;Don't push any data, for the love of God" .fragment}
Take a moment to stop and think: this is about to leave your local computer and go to `GitHub`. Make sure you did not commit any **data**, **passwords** or **anything else you don't want to share** with the world.
:::

## Say hi to `.gitignore`, everyone
[You can absolutely keep a file *locally* in a repository, without ever committing it to the `GitHub` repo. Just let it sit there, without staging it. No harm done.]{.m-space .fragment}

[If this is a long-term situation, however, you may find it tidier to list the file in `.gitignore`. This is a special file that tells `Git` to just ***ignore*** things inside a local folder.]{.m-space .fragment}

:::{.fragment}
My `.gitignore` usuallly looks something like this:
``` sh
.DS_Store # macOS

.Rhistory # for R projects # or __pycache__/ # for Python projects

data/ # All things data
*.csv
*.rds
*.RData
*.sav
```
:::

## [Exercise]{.bg-jasmine}: take an existing project and make into a `GitHub` repo

1. Choose an existing project on your local computer
2. Create a new repository for it on `GitHub` (you can use a Private one if you are feeling paranoid)
3. Clone it and bring your existing project over
4. Check that your new files appear as *new untracked files*.
5. Add a `.gitignore` to make sure your sensitive files are protected
6. Stage and commit 
7. Push to your remote repo 
8. Confirm that you project is now on `GitHub`, and rejoice!

## Why `GitHub` first?
[This is a somewhat technical but important point about `Git`.]{.l-space}

There is a big advantage of the *GitHub first, then RStudio/R* workflow: 

* the remote `GitHub` repo is already configured as the `origin remote` for your local repo
* your local `main` branch is now tracking the `main` on `GitHub`. 

[The practical implication is that you are now set up to `push` and `pull`. No need to fanny around setting up `Git` remotes and tracking branches on the command line.]{.l-space}

*Wait, what are you talking about?* 

Let's a look at:
``` sh
git remote show origin
```

## 3. Existing project, `GitHub` last
If you have followed any other `Git` tutorial however, chances are that your first step 
would look something like: 

::: panel-tabset

### In the shell
``` sh
git init
```

### Can be de done in&ensp;`R`&ensp;too, fyi
``` r
usethis::use_git()
```

:::

[In this situation, you will have an existing project, that is **already a `Git` repo** (with a history you care about), but it does not have a remote `GitHub` repo yet.]{.l-up-space .m-space .fragment}

:::{.fragment}
This may be less desirable for a novice because there are more opportunities to get confused and make a mistake.

:::

## Create and connect a `GitHub` repo

::: panel-tabset

### In&ensp;`R`
Yet again, `usethis` to the rescue

> Note: you <ins>must</ins> have a **personal access token (PAT)** configured for this.
``` r
usethis::use_github()
```

[What will happen:]{m-up-space}

* Creates a new repo on GitHub.
* Configures that new repo as the **origin remote** for the local repo.
* Sets up your local default branch (e.g. main) to track same brain on origin 
* Does an initial push
* Opens the new repo in your browser

### In the shell
First, create a new repo on `GitHub` (you already know how), but:

* give it the sane name of your local project’s directory
* Do <ins>not</ins> initialize this repository with anything in it (no `README`)

Now, in the shell:
``` sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/<YOUR-REPOSITORY>.git
```
[Push and cement the tracking relationship between your local main branch and main on `GitHub` (or whatever your default branch is)]{.m-up-space}
``` sh
git push --set-upstream origin main
```
