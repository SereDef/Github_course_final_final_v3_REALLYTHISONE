## Build an [online presence]{.orange}: `GitHub Pages` {.scrollable}
`GitHub` offers static **website hosting** directly from your repository via **`GitHub Pages`**. With *very minimal set-up* you get a website that:

* is completely [**free**]{.orange} (for public repositories).<br>You can even use your own *custom domain* at no extra cost
* is *automatically deployed*: just push your code and your site updates instantly
* has built-in version control (`Git` history and rollback capability)

:::{.fragment}
*But... what can I use it for?*

* **Personal and/or lab website** (e.g. see [mine](https://seredef.github.io/))
* A project website or **documentation** page (e.g. see [this R package](https://seredef.github.io/verywise/index.html))
* Presetations or **courses** (like this one!)
* A **blog**
* (With a bit of extra work) an interactive **dashboard**

## Build an [online presence]{.orange}: just plain `GitHub`
Even without `Pages`, the browsability of `GitHub` makes your work accessible to people who care about your content but who don’t (yet) use `Git` themselves. 

Here are some tips to make your repos look *extra nice*:

:::{.fragment .m-up-space}
#### `README`s are quite powerful
You already know that `GitHub` renders `README.md` at the top-level of your repo (as a *landing page*). But did you know you can have **multiple `README.md` files**, for example, for any logical group of files or mini project-within-your-project (i.e. a sub-directory in your repository). You can use the `README.md` to annotate these files, collect relevant links, etc.
:::

:::{.fragment .m-up-space}
#### Use tabular data 
`GitHub` will nicely render tabular data in the form of `.csv` (comma-separated) and `.tsv` (tab-separated) files. Take advantage of this!
:::

:::{.fragment .m-up-space}
#### Images, HTML, `Python`/`R` notebooks... it's all fair game
:::

## Run a course with GitHub
[`GitHub Organizations` are excellent tools for interactive educational courses.]{.l-space}

Check out this [tutorial](https://happygitwithr.com/classroom-overview)

## [Finding stuff]{.orange}: let me `GitHub Search` that for you
Did you ever find a function that *seems useful* has no examples? Or is poorly documented? Wouldn’t it be nice to find functioning instances of it “*in the wild*”?

[The **`GitHub Search`** box is just what the doctor ordered.]{.l-up-space}

![](imgs/github-search.png){.absolute bottom="550" right="30" height="10%"}

[For example, wonder how packages on CRAN use the `llply()` function from `plyr`?]{.l-up-space}
``` sh
"llply" owner:cran language:R
```
[**`GitHub Search`** has *loads* of useful setting and options.]{.l-up-space} 

Read about them [here](https://github.com/search/advanced), [here](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code/) and [here](https://help.github.com/articles/search-syntax/)


## [Finding stuff]{.orange}: the `file finder`

![](imgs/github-file-finder.png){.absolute bottom="640" right="70" height="10%"}

:::{.column width='70%'}
[Whenever you are on a repo's page, you can press [`t`]{.bg-highlight} to<br>activate the [file finder](https://github.blog/news-insights/the-library/introducing-the-file-finder/).]{.l-up-space}
:::

This is *very helpful*, especially when there are files tucked into lots of subdirectories.

:::{.fragment .l-up-space}
#### [You found it, don't loose it]{.darkblue}
When you’re viewing a specific file, you can press [`y`]{.bg-highlight} to get a [permanent link](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/getting-permanent-links-to-files) to that specific file or specific line(s) inside that file.

[*What's a permanent link?*]{.m-up-space}

Good question. This is a link that will not break, even when the file is deleted, renamed or if lines get inserted / deleted.
:::

## Let people correct you on the internet
[They love that!]{.m-space}

*Speaking of links*, did you know that you can create a link that takes people directly to an **editing interface** in the browser. 

> Behind the scenes (assuming the click-er is signed into `GitHub`, and they are not you) this will create a fork in their account and send you a pull request for the changes. 

[An [**edit link**]{.orange} would look something like this:]{.l-up-space}
``` txt
[Click here to edit!](<YOU REPO URL>/edit/main/<path to target source file>)
```

## Automate tasks: `GitHub Actions`
Automated (and reproducible!) workflows can be built directly into `GitHub` with `Actions`.

:::{.fragment .l-up-space}
*But... what can I use it for?*

* **Automatically re-run analyses** (in a clean environment), for example, whenever code or data changes --> freezing computations for **reproducibility**.
* Automatically render **manuscripts**, **presentations**, and/or **reports**
* **Schedule** workflows (regularly or with "manual: triggers), e.g. 
    - Search PubMed for new papers on a topic, every month
    - Whenever the code (or the data) is *updated*, run some validation checks / tests (a little something called **continuous integration**)
:::

:::{.fragment .m-up-space}
There is a whole [marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) of `Actions` out there.

Also check this [tutorial](https://cct-datascience.quarto.pub/github-actions-for-automating-scientific-workflows/#/title-slide) for researchers.
:::

## Project management with `GitHub Projects`
`GitHub` provides built-in tools for planning, tracking, and coordinating work so you can manage entire projects alongside your code and writing.​

`GitHub Projects` sits on top of issues and pull requests as a flexible **table**, **board**, and **roadmap** that you can *filter*, *sort*, and *group* to match your workflow.​

![](imgs/github-project-management.png){.absolute top="320" right="210" height="65%"}

## Some extra tips for the way: cleaning up
You can delete the "local" repo whenever you like (it’s just a regular directory on your computer).

[But, if you are doing it in the shell, use:]{.l-up-space}
``` sh
rm -rf <YOUR-REPOSITORY>
```
`-rf` will save you some time saying "yes" delete this hidden git file a gazillion times

[You also want to remove the remote repo?]{.l-up-space}

In the browser, go to your repo’s landing page > Click on *Settings* > Scroll all the way down, click on *delete repository* and do as it asks.

## Some extra tips for the way: comparing versions
`RStudio` will provide you with pretty ways to see the differences between versions.

In the shell, use:
``` sh
git diff
```

## Conclusions and goodbyes
There you have it, you are now an honest `GitHub` citizen. 

[Now just [*“lather, rinse, repeat”*]{.orange}.]{.l-space}

The tools and workflows we saw today are widely regarded as **current best practice**, yet, sadly, we generally neither practice nor preach it in academic settings.

...but that was until you came around!

[**Thanks for listening to me <3**]{.darkblue .center .l-up-space .l-space}

See you on `GitHub`

xoxo,

`SereDef`
