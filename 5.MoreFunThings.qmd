## Build an online presence: `GitHub Pages` {.scrollable}
`GitHub` offers static **website hosting** directly from your repository via **`GitHub Pages`**. 

With *very minimal set-up* you get a website that:

* is completely **free** (for public repositories). You can also use your own custom domain at no extra cost
* is *automatically deployed*: just push your code and your site updates instantly
* has built-in version control (`Git` history and rollback capability)

:::{.fragment}
*But... what can I use it for?*

* Personal and/or lab website (e.g. see [mine](https://seredef.github.io/))
* A project website or documentation page (e.g. see [this R package](https://seredef.github.io/verywise/index.html))
* Presetations or courses (like this one!)
* A blog
* (With a bit of extra work) an interactive dashboard

## Build an online presence: just plain `GitHub`
Even without `Pages`, the browsability of `GitHub` makes your work accessible to people who care about your content but who don’t (yet) use `Git` themselves. 

Here are some tips to make your repos look *extra nice*:

:::{.fragment .m-up-space}
#### `README`s are quite powerful
You already know that `GitHub` renders `README.md` at the top-level of your repo (as a *landing page*). But did you know you can have **multiple `README.md` files**, for example, for any logical group of files or mini project-within-your-project (i.e. a sub-directory in your repository). You can use the `README.md` to annotate these files, collect relevant links, etc.
:::

:::{.fragment .m-up-space}
#### Use tabular data 
`GitHub` will nicely render tabular data in the form of `.csv` (comma-separated) and `.tsv` (tab-separated) files. Take advantage of this!
:::

:::{.fragment .m-up-space}
#### Images, HTML, `Python`/`R` notebooks... it's all fair game
:::

## Run a course with GitHub
[`GitHub Organizations` are excellent tools for interactive educational courses.]{.l-space}

Check out this [tutorial](https://happygitwithr.com/classroom-overview)

## Finding stuff: let me `GitHub Search` that for you
Did you ever find a function that *seems useful* has no examples? Or is poorly documented? Wouldn’t it be nice to find functioning instances of it “*in the wild*”?

The **`GitHub Search`** box is just what the doctor ordered 

![](imgs/github-search.png){.absolute bottom="200" right="50" height="10%"}

[For example, see how packages on CRAN use the `llply()` function from `plyr`:]{.l-up-space}
``` sh
"llply" owner:cran language:R
```
**`GitHub Search`** has *loads* of useful setting and options. 

Read about them [here](https://github.com/search/advanced), [here](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code/) and [here](https://help.github.com/articles/search-syntax/)


## Finding stuff: the file finder

![](imgs/github-file-finder.png){.absolute top="90" right="50" height="60%"}

[Press [`t`]{.bg-highlight} to activate the [file finder](https://github.blog/news-insights/the-library/introducing-the-file-finder/) whenever you’re in a repo’s file and directory view.]{.l-up-space}

*AWESOME*, especially when there are files tucked into lots of subdirectories.

:::{.fragment .l-up-space}
#### You found it, don't loose it
Press [`y`]{.bg-highlight} to get a [permanent link](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/getting-permanent-links-to-files) when you’re viewing a specific file. 

Watch what changes in the URL. 

This is handy if you are want to link to a specific file or to specific lines, so that your links will not break, even when the file is deleted, renamed or if lines get inserted or deleted.
:::

## Let people correct you on the internet
[They love that!]{.m-space}

You can also create a link that takes people directly to an **editing interface** in the browser. 

> Behind the scenes (assuming the click-er is signed into `GitHub`, and they are not you) this will create a fork in their account and send you a pull request for the changes. 

[An edit link would look something like this:]{.l-up-space}
``` r
[Click here to edit!](<URL to your repo>/edit/main/<path to target source file>)
```

## Automate tasks: `GitHub Actions`
Automated (and reproducible!) workflows can be built directly into `GitHub` with `Actions`.

:::{.fragment .l-up-space}

* Automatically re-run analyses (in a clean environment), for example, whenever code or data changes; freezing computations for reproducibility.
* Automatically render manuscripts, presentations, and/or reports
* Schedule workflows (e.g. check for new papers on a topic, either regularly or with manual triggers)
* Continuous integration: e.g. when the code (or the data) is updated, run some validation checks / test.
:::

:::{.fragment .l-up-space}
There is a whole [marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) of `Actions` out there.

Check this [tutorial](https://cct-datascience.quarto.pub/github-actions-for-automating-scientific-workflows/#/title-slide) for researchers.

## Project management with `GitHub Projects`
`GitHub` provides built-in tools for planning, tracking, and coordinating work so you can manage entire projects alongside your code and writing.​

`GitHub Projects` sits on top of issues and pull requests as a flexible table, board, and roadmap that you can filter, sort, and group to match your workflow.​

![](imgs/github-project-management.png){.absolute top="130" right="50" height="65%"}

## Some extra tips: cleaning up
You can delete the "local" repo (It’s just a regular directory on your computer).

Note, if you are doing it in the shell, use:
``` sh
rm -rf <YOUR-REPOSITORY>
```
`-rf` will save you some time saying "yes" delete this hidden git file a gazillion times

Then, in the browser, go to your repo’s landing page on `GitHub` > Click on *Settings* > Scroll down, click on *delete repository* and do as it asks.

## Some extra tips: comparing versions

``` sh
git diff
```

## Conclusions and goodbyes
The workflows described here are widely regarded as current best practice, yet we generally neither practice nor preach it in academic settings.

Now just “lather, rinse, repeat”. Do work somewhere: locally or on GitHub. Commit it. Push it or pull it, depending on where you did the work, get local and remote “synced up”. Repeat.

Git from the inside out

Git in Practice by Mike McQuaid is an more approachable book, probably better than Pro Git (below) for most people starting out. Ancillary materials on GitHub.

The book Pro Git is fantastic and comprehensive.

Oh My Git! is a free and open source interactive game for learning Git. It’s very beginner friendly, using a graph to visualise the worktree. Lessons can be completed using a playing card interface in addition to the built-in command line, which is there for when users become more comfortable.

GitHub’s own training materials may be helpful. They also point to many other resources

Find a powerful Git client (chapter 8) if you’d like to minimize your usage of Git from the command line.
