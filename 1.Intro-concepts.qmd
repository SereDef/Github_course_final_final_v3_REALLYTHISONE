## Welcome

[Welcome to our first **`Git` & `Github`** course!]{.l-space}

::: fragment
Hi :wave: &ensp;My name is Serena --- Data Scientist&ensp;[Epidemiology / Neuroscience / Psychology]{.grey}

[***Disaclaimer time***: I am <ins>not an expert</ins><br>I use these tools daily and find them, honestly, really useful]{.m-up-space .l-space}
:::

::: fragment
Today, I'll walk with you as you:

-   Find out some (*very cool*) ways to integrate `Git` and `GitHub` into your daily work
-   Install and congifure `Git` and get it working smoothly with `GitHub` <br>[{{< fa arrow-right-long >}}&ensp;in the ***shell*** & in ***R***/***RStudio***]{.grey}
-   Practice a few key **workflows** to solve common problems

### [About you]{.darkblue}

[<ins>No previous experience</ins> required, beside a general familiarity with *data analysis*.]{.s-space}

[You will get the *most* out of this workshop if you are an **`R` user**.]{.l-space}

### [About this worshop]{.darkblue}

[It is <ins>not a complete guide</ins>. It is more of a [*Git-starter pack*]{.orange} for [**research** / **teaching**]{.orange} activities.]{.m-space}

::: {.callout-tip title="Hungry for more?"}
There are a lot of excellent Git/Github tutorial materials online.<br>Check out the [Resources]() at the end of this presentation for some suggestions.

## Pre-trip checklist

You already have:

- [x] A (free) `GitHub` **account**
    -   Students and educational/research staff: [GitHub Education](https://github.com/education)
    -   Research/lab groups or courses: [GitHub Organizations](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations)

- [x] A laptop with:
    -   `Git` installed
    -   `R` and `RStudio` (or `Positron`) up-to-date

- [x] Stickers 

&emsp;&emsp;[{{< fa square-full >}}]{style="color:pink"}&ensp;help

## Roadtrip agenda

1.  Big-picture motivation (*and a pinch of ranting*)
    -   Why would a researcher use a *version control system* (e.g., `Git`)?
    -   What's the point of hosting your work online (e.g., on `GitHub`)?

2.  [Useful `Git`/`GitHub` **concepts** I keep in my purse]{.m-space}
3.  [Getting started (the right way): **configuration** climbing]{.m-space}
4.  Early `Git` wins: some basic **workflows** for everyday life

5.  The rest of the game: some lesser-known fun things you can do with `Github`
    -   e.g. `Github Pages`, `Search`, and `Actions`

## Is it going to hurt?

[Yes.]{.m-space}

::: fragment
[<ins>Before you can get started</ins>, [you have to: install `Git`, get local `Git` talking to `GitHub`, and make sure `RStudio` can talk to local `Git` (and, therefore, `GitHub`).]{.grey}]{.s-space}

***Excuse me,* do you have a moment to talk about [*version control*]{.darkblue} ?**
:::

![](imgs/git-witness.png){.absolute top=150 right=50}


## Why bother with all this?
[I can think of two main reasons:]{.m-space}

:::{.fragment .column width="46%" .bg-highlight}
[*The noble reasons*]{.darkblue .center}

**Science is in *bad shape* people.**

[Replicability]{.orange} and [traceability]{.orange} of scientific claims is horrifyingly insufficient, across fields.

[*You analysis is the scientific product, the paper is just advertisement.*]{.m-up-space} 

And analyses *should* (in principle)<br>be **directly accessible** to others,<br>or at least carefully<br>documented...

:::

:::{.column width="3%"}
:::
:::{.fragment .column width="46%" .bg-yellow}
[*The selfish reasons*]{.orange .center}

Research produces ***many* files**: data files, figures, tables, docs, slides, and (yes) code...

Most of these files [**evolve** over the course of a project]{.orange} and often [need to be **shared**]{.orange} with others.

Without explicit and structured management, project organization can easily descend into [*chaos*]{.orange}, and taking your mental wellbeing with it (ask me how I know...)

## The [*"poor man's version"*]{.darkblue} of version control

![](imgs/poor-man-git-1.png){.absolute top="150" left="150" height="700px"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This *unhappy* result can be avoided by [repurposing]{.darkblue} tools and workflows from the software development world.

## What is `Git`?

![](imgs/linus-torvalds-1.png){.fixed-bottom-right style="--w: 35%;"}

`Git` is a [**version control system**]{.orange}.

It manages the evolution of a *set of files* (a [**repository**]{.darkblue} or [**repo**]{.darkblue}) in a sane, highly structured way.

::: {.text-wrap style="--w: 70%;"}
<br><br> [`Git`'s original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects.]{.fragment} <br><br>
[It is like a [*"TrackChanges"*]{.darkblue} feature from Microsoft Word, but more rigorous, powerful, and scaled up to multiple files.]{.fragment} <br><br>
:::

::: {.text-wrap style="--w: 65%;"}
[It enables the distribution of *any file* across different **people**, **computers**, and across **time**.]{.fragment}
:::

## *Now the bad news*

[`Git` was <ins>not built for you</ins>.]{.m-up-space}

[You will undoubtedly notice this, so it's best to know in advance.]{.grey}

`Git`'s model of file management can feel uncomfortably *rigid*, especially for beginners.

Happily, there are many helpful **tools** that mediate your interactions with `Git`.

## What is `GitHub`?

`GitHub` complements `Git` by providing a polished [**user interface**]{.orange} and [**distribution**]{.orange} mechanism for `Git` [repositories]{.darkblue}. 

::: {.fragment} 

* `Git` = software you use locally to record changes to a set of files. 
* `GitHub` = hosting service that provides a `Git`-aware home for such projects on the internet.

::: {.fragment .column .bg-highlight width="50%"}
[`GitHub` is like [DropBox]{.darkblue} or [Google Drive]{.darkblue}, but much, *much* better.]{.l-space}

It allows others to browse project files, explore their history, sync up with the current version, and even propose or make changes.

::: {.fragment .column .bg-highlight width="40%"}

[Let's take a look!]{.fragment .center}

## Good examples in bio-research
A diverse range of efforts (from individual, to labs, to global collaborations) have chosen `GitHub` as productive place to share code and ideas

[***Fundamental `Git` / `GitHub` concepts I keep in my purse***]{.darkblue}
:::

## Git basics

Let's talk a bit more about `Git`, introduce the most important basic ideas and define some `Git` **vocabulary** and link each concept to data science tasks and projects.

Keep in mind that *actual usage* is the most effective way to build up a useful mental model for `Git`.

As before, there many excellent external resources for `Git`, which you can find in the Resources.

## Repositories (repos) and roles

Recall: `Git` manages the evolution of a set of files – called a **repository** or **repo**.

A `repository` can be **public** or **private**.<br><br>

The [**owner**]{.orange} of a repository can grant permission to others: e.g. read (only relevant for private), write (or `push`) or admin access to others.

## Staging and commits

A `commit` is a **snapshot** of one or more files inside a folder.

instead of saving a copy of a file, versioning it like _v2 or _SD, you create a commit. on the surface nothing changes but the history of that file is secretly saved 

When you commit a file or files, some information is saved along with the changes to the file

You can add more information about the changes you’ve made in a commit **message**

## Time travel, hashs and tags

Git stores the whole history of your project and makes it available to you 

Each of these commits has an id called a hash, wich makes it identifiable 

Getting the files from a commit in the past is known as doing a check out

I can tell Git what commit I want to check out using the commit hash

hash - a computer generated id
checkout - time travel to a specific commit

## Parallel universes: branches

So far, everything has been very linear and ordered

This isn’t really how projects work, sometimes you want to make easily discardable experiments

The way you do this in Git is with branches

A branch is a moveable label attached to a commit

The default branch name in Git is main (used to be master)

## Parallel universes: merging
Branches are useful for trying out stuff, as they’re really easy to throw away if you decide you don’t like your changes

Switch to a branch

git checkout \[branch-name\]

Once you’re happy with some work, you need a way to get it back into

To get changes from one branch into another, you merge them

branch - a moveable label that points to a commit
merge - the combination of two or more branches

## Remotes, cloning, pulling, pushing and forking
Everyone knows that you should back up your work regularly

Ideally to somewhere that is geographically distinct from your computer

n Git this place is called a remote. A very popular remote is Github

To get some work from a remote for the first time you clone it

remote - a computer with a repo on it
clone - get the repo from the remote for the first time
pull - get new commits to the repo from the remote
push - send your new commits to the remote

## Issues

It's a list of things, bugs, feature requests, to dos, whatever

Issues are tightly integrated with email and therefore allow you to copy/embed important conversations in the associated repo.

Issues can be assigned to people (e.g., to dos) and tagged (“bug” or “progress-report”).

Issues are tightly integrated with commits and therefore allow you to record that the changes in this commit solve that problem which was discussed in that issue.

As a new user of GitHub, one of the most productive things you can do is to use GitHub issues to provide a clear bug report or feature request for a package you use.

## Pull requests

Git allows a project to have multiple, independent branches of development, with the notion that some should eventually be merged back into the main development branch.

A pull request is a formal proposal that says: “Here are some changes I would like to make.” It might be linked to a specific issue: “Related to #14.” or “Fixes #56”. GitHub facilitates and preserves the discussion of the proposal, holistically and line-by-line.

## Questions?

No? Let's play a **game**

## Benefits of using hosted version control

Even for [*private solo projects*]{.darkblue}, there are advantages to keeping a synced copy on `GitHub`:

::: fragment
1.  When you are new with coding (or, frankly, even when you are not), it is common to [mess things up]{.orange}. <br> Sometimes the easiest fix is to clone a fresh copy from `GitHub`, patch things up, and move on with your life.
:::

::: fragment
2.  The highly functional web interface makes it a pleasure to browse through your own work. <br> You can [navigate]{.orange} and [search]{.orange} through multiple projects and files and across time.
:::

## Benefits of using hosted version control

enable collaboration and knowledge sharing between different remote contributors.

-   Doing your work becomes tightly integrated with organizing, recording, and disseminating it. It's not a separate, burdensome task you are tempted to neglect

-   Collaboration is much more structured, with powerful tools for asynchronous workand managing versions

-   The marginal effort required to create a web presence for a project is negligible

-   GitHub makes a fantastic course management system for teachers. You can exchange actual working code with your students and explore the associated results

-   WIDELY used outside these walls (required in most job positions)

-   By using common mechanics across work modes (research, teaching, analysis), you achieve basic competence quickly and avoid the demoralizing forget-relearn cycle
