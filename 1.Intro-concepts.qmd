## Welcome

Welcome to our first **`Git` & `Github`** course!<br><br>

::: {.fragment}

#### [Hi]{.darkblue-bold}

My name is Serena, I work at Erasmus MC now for a few years mostly on epidemiology / molcular biology / neuroscience things.

**Disaclaimer time**: I am <ins>not an expert</ins>, I just use these tools somewhat often and find them, honestly, very cool<br><br>
:::

::: {.fragment}
Today, I'll walk with you as you:

-   Find out some (very cool) ways to integrate `Git` and `GitHub` into your daily work
-   Install and congifure `Git` and get it working smoothly with `GitHub` <br>[---\> in the ***shell*** & in ***RStudio***]{style="color:grey"}
-   Learn about a few key **workflows** for your most common tasks
:::

## Some (more) disclaimers

::: fragment
### [About you]{.darkblue-bold}

<ins>No previous experience</ins> is required, beside a general familiarity with *data analysis*.

You will get the *most* out of this workshop if you are an **`R`** user. <br><br>
:::

:::: fragment
### [About this worshop]{.darkblue-bold}

It is <ins>not a complete guide</ins>. It is more of a *Git-starter pack* for **research / teaching** activities. <br><br>

::: callout-tip
There are a lot of excellent Git/Github tutorial materials online (see [Resources]() for some suggestions).
:::
::::

## Roadtrip checklist

You already have:

-   A (free) `GitHub` account
    -   Students and educational/research staff: [GitHub Education](https://github.com/education)
    -   Courses or research/lab groups: [GitHub Organizations](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations)
-   A laptop with:
    -   `Git` installed
    -   `R` and `RStudio` (or `Positron`) up-to-date
-   Stickers (help, done, question)

## Roadtrip agenda

::: fragment
1.  Big-picture motivation, people
    -   Why would a researcher use a *version control system* (e.g., `Git`)?
    -   What's the point of hosting your work online (e.g., on `GitHub`)?
:::

::: incremental
2.  Useful `Git`/`GitHub` **concepts** I keep in my purse
3.  Getting started (the right way): **configuration** climbing
4.  Early `Git` wins: some basic **workflows** for everyday life
:::

::: fragment
5.  The rest of the game: some lesser-known fun things you can do with `Github`
    -   e.g. `Github Pages`, `Search`, and `Actions`
:::

## Is it going to hurt?

Yes. <br><br>

::: fragment
 <ins>Before you can get started</ins>, you have to: install `Git`, get local `Git` talking to `GitHub`, and make sure `RStudio` can talk to local `Git` (and, therefore, `GitHub`).

[This is **one-time** or *"once-per-computer"* pain]{.bg-highlight} & [we will do it **together**.]{.bg-highlight} <br><br>
:::

::: fragment
 <ins>Beginner-intermediate use</ins> require (small) **changes to your normal, daily workflow**: dedicate a directory to each project, make it a `git` repository, (optionally) make it a RStudio project, periodically make `commit`s and push them to `Github`.

[It feels weird at first but quickly becomes second nature]{.bg-highlight} & [we will do it **together**.]{.bg-highlight}. <br><br>
:::

:::: fragment
<ins>Advanced use</ins>

Do you use GitHub to **work with other people** or to **coordinate your own work from multiple computers**? *Knock-knock* - Who's there? **`merge conflicts`**.

:::{.callout-caution title="Handling **`merge conflicts`**"}
This is not one-time pain. The best remedy is **prevention**, which we will talk about today. <br> See [Resources]() for more advanced tips on how to back out of tricky situations and tackle them on your own terms.

***Excuse me,***<br> do you have a moment to <br> talk about [version control]{.darkblue}?
:::

## The problem

Scientific research and teaching produce [*many* files]{.orange-bold}!

There are data files, figures, tables, reports, slides, and (yes) source code...

<br>

Most of these files [**evolve** over the course of a project]{.bg-highlight-text} and often [need to be **shared** with others]{.bg-highlight-text}.

<br>

Without explicit and structured management, project organization can easily descend into [chaos]{.orange}, taking time away from the primary work and reducing the quality of the final product (and of your life).

## The [*"poor man's version"*]{.darkblue} of version control

![](imgs/poor-man-git-1.png){.absolute top="150" left="20"}

-------------------------------------------------------------

This *unhappy* result can be avoided by repurposing tools and workflows from the software development world.

## What is `Git`?

![](imgs/linus-torvalds-1.png){.fixed-bottom-right style="--w: 35%;"}

`Git` is a **version control system**.

It manages the evolution of a *set of files* (a **repository** or **repo**) in a sane, highly structured way.

::: {.text-wrap style="--w: 70%;"}
<br><br>
[`Git`'s original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects.]{.fragment}
<br><br>
[It is like a *"TrackChanges"* feature from Microsoft Word, but more rigorous, powerful, and scaled up to multiple files.]{.fragment}
<br><br>

:::

::: {.text-wrap style="--w: 65%;"}
[It enables the distribution of files across different **people**, **computers**, and **time**.]{.fragment}
:::

## *Now the bad news*

![](imgs/linus-torvalds-2.png){.fixed-bottom-right style="--w: 35%;"}

::: fragment
<br>

Git was <ins>not built for you</ins>.

You will undoubtedly notice this, so it's best to know in advance.

Git's model of file management can feel uncomfortably *rigid*, especially for beginners.
:::

::: {.fragment .text-wrap style="--w: 60%;"}
<br>

Happily, there are many helpful **tools** that mediate your interactions with `Git`.

## What is `GitHub`?
`GitHub` complements `Git` by providing a polished [user interface]{.orange-bold} and [distribution]{.orange-bold} mechanism for `Git` repositories.
::: {.fragment}
 * `Git` = software you use locally to record changes to a set of files.
 * `GitHub` = hosting service that provides a `Git`-aware home for such projects on the internet.
:::

<br>

::: {.fragment .column .bg-highlight width="50%"}
`GitHub` is like DropBox or Google Drive, but much, *much* better.<br><br>

It allows others to browse project files, explore their history, sync up with the current version, and even propose or make changes.
:::

::: {.column width="2%"}
:::

::: {.fragment .column .bg-highlight width="40%"}
Many operations can be done entirely in the browser, including editing or adding files.

[Let's take a look!]{.fragment}

[*Fundamental `Git` / `GitHub` concepts I keep in my purse*]{.darkblue-bold}
:::

## Git basics
Let's talk a bit more about `Git`, introduce the most important basic ideas and define some `Git` **vocabulary** and link each concept to data science tasks and projects.

Keep in mind that *actual usage* is the most effective way to build up a useful mental model for `Git`. 

As before, there many excellent external resources for `Git`, which you can find in the Resources.

## Repositories (repos) and roles
Recall: `Git` manages the evolution of a set of files – called a **repository** or **repo**.

A `repository` can be **public** or **private**.<br><br>

The [owner]{.orange-bold} of a repository can grant permission to others: e.g. read (only relevant for private), write (or `push`) or admin access to others.

## Staging, commits and tags
Commmits 

## Remotes, cloning and forking

## Branches
Branches 

Switch to a branch

git checkout [branch-name]

## Merging and conflicts

## Issues
It's a list of things, bugs, feature requests, to dos, whatever

Issues are tightly integrated with email and therefore allow you to copy/embed important conversations in the associated repo.

Issues can be assigned to people (e.g., to dos) and tagged (“bug” or “progress-report”).

Issues are tightly integrated with commits and therefore allow you to record that the changes in this commit solve that problem which was discussed in that issue.

As a new user of GitHub, one of the most productive things you can do is to use GitHub issues to provide a clear bug report or feature request for a package you use.

## Pull requests
Git allows a project to have multiple, independent branches of development, with the notion that some should eventually be merged back into the main development branch.

A pull request is a formal proposal that says: “Here are some changes I would like to make.” It might be linked to a specific issue: “Related to #14.” or “Fixes #56”. GitHub facilitates and preserves the discussion of the proposal, holistically and line-by-line.

## Questions?

No? Let's play a **game**

## Benefits of using hosted version control

Even for [*private solo projects*]{.darkblue}, there are advantages to keeping a synced copy on `GitHub`:

::: fragment
1.  When you are new with coding (or, frankly, even when you are not), it is common to [mess things up]{.orange}. <br> Sometimes the easiest fix is to clone a fresh copy from `GitHub`, patch things up, and move on with your life.
:::

::: fragment
2.  The highly functional web interface makes it a pleasure to browse through your own work. <br> You can [navigate]{.orange} and [search]{.orange} through multiple projects and files and across time.
:::

## Benefits of using hosted version control

-   Doing your work becomes tightly integrated with organizing, recording, and disseminating it. It's not a separate, burdensome task you are tempted to neglect

-   Collaboration is much more structured, with powerful tools for asynchronous workand managing versions

-   The marginal effort required to create a web presence for a project is negligible

-   GitHub makes a fantastic course management system for teachers. You can exchange actual working code with your students and explore the associated results

-   WIDELY used outside these walls (required in most job positions)

-   By using common mechanics across work modes (research, teaching, analysis), you achieve basic competence quickly and avoid the demoralizing forget-relearn cycle
