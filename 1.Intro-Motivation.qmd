## Welcome

[Welcome to our first **`Git` & `Github`** course!]{.l-space}

::: fragment
Hi 👋  My name is Serena --- Data Scientist [Epidemiology / Neuroscience / Psychology]{.grey}

[***Disaclaimer time***: I am <ins>not an expert</ins><br>I use these tools daily and find them, honestly, really useful]{.m-up-space .l-space}
:::

::: fragment
Today, I'll walk with you as you:

-   Find out some (*very cool*) ways to integrate `Git` and `GitHub` into your daily work
-   Install and congifure `Git` and get it working smoothly with `GitHub` <br>[{{< fa arrow-right-long >}} in the ***shell*** & in ***R***/***RStudio***]{.grey}
-   Practice a few key **workflows** to solve common problems

### [About you]{.darkblue}

[<ins>No previous experience</ins> required, beside a general familiarity with *data analysis*.]{.s-space}

[You will get the *most* out of this workshop if you are an **`R` user**.]{.l-space}

:::: fragment
### [About this worshop]{.darkblue}

[It is <ins>not a complete guide</ins>. It is more of a [*Git-starter pack*]{.orange} for [**research** / **teaching**]{.orange} activities.]{.m-space}

::: {.callout-tip title="Hungry for more?"}
There are a lot of excellent Git/Github tutorial materials online.<br>Check out the [Resources]() at the end of this presentation for some suggestions.

## Roadtrip agenda

1.  Big-picture motivation (*and a pinch of ranting*)
    -   Why would a researcher use a *version control system* (e.g., `Git`)?
    -   What's the point of hosting your work online (e.g., on `GitHub`)?

::: incremental
2.  [Useful `Git`/`GitHub` **concepts** I keep in my purse]{.m-space}
3.  [Getting started (the right way): **configuration** climbing]{.m-space}
4.  Early `Git` wins: some basic **workflows** for everyday life
:::

::: {.fragment .column width="60%"}
5.  The rest of the game: some lesser-known fun things you can do with `Github`
    -   e.g. `Github Pages`, `Search`, and `Actions`

## Is it going to hurt? {.scrollable}

[Yes.]{.m-space}

::: fragment
[<ins>Before you can get started</ins>, [you have to: install `Git` and set it up properly to talk to `GitHub`.]{.grey}]{.s-space} 

[This is **one-time** or *"once-per-computer"* pain]{.bg-highlight} & [we will do it **together**]{.bg-highlight}
:::

::: fragment
[<ins>Beginner--intermediate use</ins> requires[(*small*) changes]{.orange} to your normal, daily workflow: [e.g. dedicate a directory to each project, make it a `git` repository, periodically make commits and push them to `Github`.]{.grey}]{.s-space .l-up-space}

[*It feels weird at first* but quickly becomes second nature]{.bg-yellow} & [we will do it **together**]{.bg-highlight}
:::

::: fragment
[<ins>Advanced `GitHub` use</ins>, e.g. to **work with other people** or **coordinate your own work from multiple computers**? [*Knock-knock* --- Who's there? ---]{.grey} [*merge conflicts*.]{.orange}]{.s-space .l-up-space}

[This is not one-time pain]{.bg-orange} but [the best remedy is **prevention**, which we do today]{.bg-highlight}

## Why bother with all this?

[I can think of two main reasons:]{.m-space}

::: {.fragment .column .bg-highlight width="46%"}
[*The noble reasons*]{.darkblue .center}

**Science is in *bad shape* people.**

[Replicability]{.orange} and [traceability]{.orange} of scientific claims is horrifyingly insufficient, across fields.

[*You analysis is the scientific product, the paper is just advertisement.*]{.m-up-space}

And analyses *should* (in principle)<br>be **directly accessible** to others,<br>or at least carefully<br>documented...

![](imgs/j-irreprod-results.jpg){.absolute bottom="0" left="600" width="13%" style="transform: rotate(12deg); z-index: 10;"}
:::

::: {.column width="3%"}
:::

::: {.fragment .column .bg-yellow width="46%"}
[*The selfish reasons*]{.orange .center}

Research produces ***many*** **files**: data files, figures, tables, docs, slides, and (yes) code...

Most of these files [**evolve** over the course of a project]{.orange} and often [need to be **shared**]{.orange} with others.

Without explicit and structured management, project organization can easily descend into [*chaos*]{.orange}, and taking your mental wellbeing with it (ask me how I know...)

## The [*"poor man's version"*]{.darkblue} of version control

![](imgs/poor-man-git-1.png){.absolute top="150" left="150" height="700px"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This *unhappy* result can be avoided by [repurposing]{.darkblue} tools and workflows from the software development world.

![](imgs/poor-man-git-2.png){.absolute top="150" left="150" height="700px"}

## What is `Git`?

![](imgs/linus-torvalds-1.png){.fixed-bottom-right style="--w: 35%;"}

`Git` is a [**version control system**]{.orange}.

It manages the evolution of a *set of files* (a [**repository**]{.darkblue} or [**repo**]{.darkblue}) in a sane, highly structured way.

::: {.text-wrap style="--w: 70%;"}
[`Git`'s original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects.]{.fragment .l-space .l-up-space}

[It is like a [*"TrackChanges"*]{.darkblue} feature from Microsoft Word, but more rigorous, powerful, and scaled up to multiple files.]{.fragment .l-space}
:::

::: {.text-wrap style="--w: 65%;"}
[It enables the distribution of *any file* across different **people**, **computers**, and across **time**.]{.fragment}
:::

## *Now the bad news*

[`Git` was <ins>not built for you</ins>.]{.m-up-space}

[You will undoubtedly notice this, so it's best to know in advance.]{.grey}

![](imgs/linus-torvalds-2.png){.fixed-bottom-right style="--w: 35%;"}

::: fragment
`Git`'s model of file management can feel uncomfortably *rigid*, especially for beginners.
:::

::: {.fragment .text-wrap style="--w: 60%;"}
<br>

Happily, there are many helpful **tools** that mediate your interactions with `Git`.

## What is `GitHub`?

`GitHub` complements `Git` by providing a polished [**user interface**]{.orange} and [**distribution**]{.orange} mechanism for `Git` [repositories]{.darkblue}.

:::: {.fragment}
-   `Git` = software you use locally to record changes to a set of files.
-   `GitHub` = hosting service that provides a `Git`-aware home for such projects on the internet.
::::

::: {.fragment .column .bg-highlight width="50%"}
[`GitHub` is like [DropBox]{.darkblue} or [Google Drive]{.darkblue}, but much, *much* better.]{.l-space}

It allows others to browse project files, explore their history, sync up with the current version, and even propose or make changes.
:::

::: {.column width="2%"}
:::

::: {.fragment .column .bg-highlight width="40%"}
Many operations can be done entirely in the browser, including editing or adding files.

## Some nice examples from bio-research

A diverse range of efforts (from individual, to labs, to global collaborations) have chosen `GitHub` as productive place to share code and ideas

## Benefits of using hosted version control {.scrollable}

[In a nutshel:]{.grey} doing your work becomes tightly integrated with [**organizing**]{.darkblue}, [**recording**]{.darkblue}, and [**disseminating**]{.darkblue} it. [It's not a separate, burdensome task you are tempted to *neglect*.]{.fragment}

:::{.incremental}
1.  [Tell the **story** of your project]{.orange}.<br>Make analytical decisions **traceable** by documenting them as you go.
2.  [**Back up** your work]{.orange}!
3.  [Travel back in time and **experiment**]{.orange} with changes.<br>When you are new with coding (or, frankly, even when you are not), it is common to [*mess things up*]{.orange}. Sometimes the easiest fix is to get a fresh copy from `GitHub` and move on with your life.
4.  [Make it **visible**]{.orange}: little extra effort required to create a *web presence* for a project.<br>The highly functional web interface makes it a pleasure to browse through your own work.<br>You can [navigate]{.orange} and [search]{.orange} through multiple projects and files and across time.
5.  [**Collaboration** and **knowledge sharing**]{.orange} is much easier and more structured (with collegues as well as remote contributors).<br>`GitHub` also makes a fantastic course management system for **teachers**.
6.  `Git` is WIDELY used outside these walls ([required for most job positions]{.orange}).<br>By using common mechanics across work modes (research, teaching, analysis), you achieve basic competence quickly and avoid the demoralizing forget-relearn cycle
