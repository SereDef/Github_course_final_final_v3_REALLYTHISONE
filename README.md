# Github_course_final_final_v3_REALLYTHISONE

Welcome!

On this repo you can find the materials for a **`Git` & `Github`** workshop, especially designed for researchers and teachers.

The workshope slides are hosted [here](https://seredef.github.io/Github_course_final_final_v3_REALLYTHISONE/slides.html)

## Workshop structure

1.  Big-picture motivation
    -   Why would a researcher use a *version control system* (e.g., `Git`)?
    -   What's the point of hosting your work online (e.g., on `GitHub`)?
2.  Useful `Git`/`GitHub` **concepts** I keep in my purse
3.  Getting started (the right way): **configuration** climbing
4.  Early `Git` wins: some basic **workflows** for everyday life
5.  The rest of the game: some lesser-known fun things you can do with `Github`
    -   e.g. `Github Pages`, `Search`, and `Actions`
6. Resources
