It is a good idea to be on the current major version, meaning 4.something\nEach major version is followed by several years of smaller releases (minor and patch releases). You can be more relaxed about upgrading minor versions, but you still want to stay reasonably current. I advise that you never fall more than 1 minor version behind.\n\n\n\n\n\nConcrete example: let’s say the released version of R is 4.7.1, which is totally fictional and well beyond the current version of R at the time of writing. It’s probably OK if you are still on 4.6.whatever, which is one minor version behind and is called “r-oldrel”. Being one minor version behind usually doesn’t cause trouble. Once you are 2 minor versions behind (4.5.whatever or earlier in this example), you will start to suffer. In particular, you can no longer install pre-built binary add-on packages from CRAN.\nIs your RStudio “old”? You can expect to update RStudio much more often than R itself. For example, I update RStudio every month or so, whereas I update R 1 or 2 times per year."

This is how all work was done before we got the mouse and GUIs.\nThe most common shell is bash and it gets thrown around as a proxy for “shell” sometimes, just like “Coke” and “Kleenex” are proxies for cola and tissues.\nSometimes we demo the use of a shell for certain tasks, like navigating the file system and doing Git operations, when we don’t want to or can’t use RStudio.
