Sometimes the easiest fix is to get a fresh copy from GitHub and move on with your life.\nMake it visible: little extra effort required to create a web presence for a project.The highly functional web interface makes it a pleasure to browse through your own work.You can navigate and search through multiple projects and files and across time.\nCollaboration and knowledge sharing is much easier and more structured (with collegues as well as remote contributors).GitHub also makes a fantastic course management system for teachers.\nGit is WIDELY used outside these walls (required for most job positions).By using common mechanics across work modes (research, teaching, analysis), you achieve basic competence quickly and avoid the demoralizing forget-relearn cycle"

But did you know you can have multiple README.md files, for example, for any logical group of files or mini project-within-your-project (i.e. a sub-directory in your repository). You can use the README.md to annotate these files, collect relevant links, etc.\n\n\nUse tabular data\nGitHub will nicely render tabular data in the form of .csv (comma-separated) and .tsv (tab-separated) files. Take advantage of this!\n\n\nImages, HTML, Python/R notebooks… it’s all fair game"
